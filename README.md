### How to transfer Unity project to another computer? ###
I turned the whole Unity folder into a zip file and then moved the zip file to
the other computer and unzipped it there (so in the end, I transferred over everything except hidden .git folder).
Transferring the files didn't work using SourceTree or transferring all the files like usual copy/pasting (they had to be zipped).
